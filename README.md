# 2D Games platform
A simple 2D games platform based on the SDL2 multimedia library.
Itâ€™s designed to easily append new games that are developed separately.
The platform already includes button, CSV, and window handlers for managing games and storing their data.<br>

## Install instructions
#### Build
Building requires CMake and a package manager (such as Homebrew) to be installed.

#### Dependencies 
Use Homebrew to install SDL2 and the following extensions:
<pre>
  brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer
</pre> <br>

Then build from the project directory:
<pre>
  cd games/snake 
  cmake .
  make

  cd ../tetris
  cmake .
  make

  cd ../..
  cmake .
  make
</pre>

## Adding new games
You can look at the structures of existing games and append new ones, the basic rules:<br>
1. Each game must be compiled as a shared library.
2. Each game receives pointers to WindowManager* and UserData*, and returns a UserData object.
3. If a game exits illegally, the score will be set to -1 and will not be stored in records.csv.
4. If no new record is achieved, the score will also be -1 upon return.
